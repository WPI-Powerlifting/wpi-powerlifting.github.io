            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Powerlifting Club’s purpose is to promote the sport of powerlifting 
                within the WPI community and provide student athletes with the opportunity 
                to powerlift competitively at a local, regional, and national level in the 
                USAPL powerlifting federation. </p>
                <br>
            <p>Powerlifting Club members will travel to a nearby gym on a weekly basis to 
                train with the guidance of an experienced and certified powerlifting coach 
                to prepare for competitive powerlifting meets.  </p>
                <br>
            <p>Members can also choose to join the club and participate in weekly practices 
                without participating in competitions. </p>
            <p>
                Powerlifting Club will provide students with an opportunity to grow as a team 
                and train in a group environment that encourages health, personal development, 
                and mental fortitude. Powerlifting Club members will support one another to 
                achieve their goals and become the best versions of themselves through rigorous 
                training and competition.</p>

            <h1>FAQ</h1>

            <h2>What is Powerlifting?</h2>
            <p>Powerlifting is a strength sport in which athletes compete to lift as much weight 
                as possible in the squat, bench, and deadlift for 1 repetition. </p>
                <br>
            <p>Powerlifting is a sport that requires discipline, determination, and consistent 
                training. It also requires proper technique, equipment, and coaching. It’s a test 
                of strength and power, and it attracts individuals who want to push the limit of 
                what their bodies can do.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
            <h2>Are there any requirements for joining the team?</h2>
            <p>No! Currently there are no requirements for being on the team as long as you are a 
                current student at WPI and are in good academic standing. </p>
                <br>
            <p>There are no age or sex restrictions, and competitions are divided into different 
                weight classes to ensure fairness. USAPL also performs routine drug testing to ensure 
                that athletes are not using steroids or other forms of illegal performance enhancing 
                drugs.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
            <h2>Do I have to be strong to be a Powerlifter?</h2>
            <p>Absolutely not. The WPI Powerlifting Club will take anyone regardless of current strength 
                levels and help you get stronger. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
            <h2>How much of a time commitment is Powerlifting Club?</h2>
            <p>Weekly practices take about 2.5 - 3 hrs, but if you choose to be a competitive member, you 
                will be expected to follow your training program on other days of the week during non-practice 
                time.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
            <h2>How much does it cost to be on the team?</h2>
            <p>Currently, the only cost to be on the powerlifting team is the cost associated with purchasing 
                your gym membership from Evolve Fitness and Training. 66% of this cost ($40) will be covered by 
                WPI bringing the net out of pocket cost down to just $13.6 per month. Competitive members may 
                also need to pay an additional fee to help the club afford top quality coaching, but this amount 
                will be as low as possible to allow for the most amount of students to afford this option.</p>
